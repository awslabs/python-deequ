    "You generally write unit tests for your code, but do you also test your data? Incoming data quality can make or break your machine learning application. Incorrect, missing or malformed data can have a large impact on production systems. Examples of data quality issues are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Missing values can lead to failures in production system that require non-null values (NullPointerException).\n",
    "* Changes in the distribution of data can lead to unexpected outputs of machine learning models.\n",
    "* Aggregations of incorrect data can lead to wrong business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog post, we introduce PyDeequ, an open source Python wrapper over [Deequ](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/test-data-quality-at-scale-with-deequ/) (an open source tool developed and used at Amazon).  While Deequ is written in Scala, PyDeequ allows you to use its  data quality and testing capabilities from Python and PySpark, the language of choice of many data scientists. PyDeequ democratizes and extends the power of Deequ by allowing you to use it alongside the many data science libraries that are available in that language. Furthermore, PyDeequ allows for fluid interface with [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) DataFrame as opposed to restricting within Spark DataFrames. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deequ allows you to calculate data quality metrics on your dataset, define and verify data quality constraints, and be informed about changes in the data distribution. Instead of implementing checks and verification algorithms on your own, you can focus on describing how your data should look. Deequ supports you by suggesting checks for you. Deequ is implemented on top of [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) and is designed to scale with large datasets (think billions of rows) that typically live in a distributed filesystem or a data warehouse. PyDeequ gives you access to this capability, but also allows you to use it from the familiar environment of your Python Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deequ at Amazon \n",
    "\n",
    "Deequ is being used internally at Amazon for verifying the quality of many large production datasets. Dataset producers can add and edit data quality constraints. The system computes data quality metrics on a regular basis (with every new version of a dataset), verifies constraints defined by dataset producers, and publishes datasets to consumers in case of success. In error cases, dataset publication can be stopped, and producers are notified to take action. Data quality issues do not propagate to consumer data pipelines, reducing their blast radius. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deequ is also used within [Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/model-monitor.html#model-monitor-how-it-works). Now with the availability of PyDeequ, it is finding its way into a broader set of environments - SageMaker Notebooks, AWS Glue, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of PyDeequ\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at PyDeequ’s main components, and how they relate to Deequ (shown in Figure 1). \n",
    "\n",
    "* Metrics Computation — Deequ computes data quality metrics, that is, statistics such as completeness, maximum, or correlation. Deequ uses Spark to read from sources such as Amazon S3, and to compute metrics through an optimized set of aggregation queries. You have direct access to the raw metrics computed on the data.\n",
    "* Constraint Verification — As a user, you focus on defining a set of data quality constraints to be verified. Deequ takes care of deriving the required set of metrics to be computed on the data. Deequ generates a data quality report, which contains the result of the constraint verification.\n",
    "* Constraint Suggestion — You can choose to define your own custom data quality constraints, or use the automated constraint suggestion methods that profile the data to infer useful constraints.\n",
    "* Python wrappers — You can call each of the Deequ functions using Python syntax. The wrappers translate the commands to the underlying Deequ calls, and return their response.\n",

    "\n",
    "Figure 1. Overview of PyDeequ components. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example \n",
    "\n",
    "As a running example, we use [a customer review dataset provided by Amazon](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html) on Amazon S3. We have intentionally followed the example in the [Deequ blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/test-data-quality-at-scale-with-deequ/), to show the similarity in functionality and execution. We begin the way many data science projects do: with initial data exploration and assessment in a Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the data exploration phase, you’d like to easily answer some basic questions about the data: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Are the fields that are supposed to contain unique values, really unique? Are there fields that are missing values? \n",
    "* How many distinct categories are there in the categorical fields?\n",
    "* Are there correlations between some key features?\n",
    "* If there are two supposedly similar datasets (different categories, or different time periods, say), are they really similar?\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we’ll show you how to scale this approach to large-scale datasets, using the same code on an EMR cluster. This is how you’d likely do your ML training, and later as you move into a production setting.\n",

Learn how to use _anomaly detection on data quality metrics (https://github.com/awslabs/deequ/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/amazon/deequ/examples/anomaly_detection_example.md)_ to apply tests on metrics that change over time.\n",
